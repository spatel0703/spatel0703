- 👋 Hi, I’m Shrey Patel
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring new innovative technologies and taking part in projects particularly in the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into Operating Systems concepts as part of my coursework. This includes gaining insights into process management, memory management, multiprogramming, and resource allocation and management. I'm excited to apply these theoretical principles in real-world scenarios and accumulate practical hands-on experience. In addition, I am currently learning more about supervised and unsupervised learning in my machine learning course. Outside of class, I am working to
become more proficient in SQL and learn more about Azure
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve creating user experiences that leverage data-focused libraries with machine learning principles.
